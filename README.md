Wow Saturday January 1, 2025 and now I come on github again. The stress is overwhelming me, facing imposter syndrome. Just recently I realized how much I'm already through with my education, like more than half way to graduations and reflecting on myself: no experience/internship in this field, no projects, no connections just being an introvert; like what am I even doing, what have I been doing, bruh. So disappointed. I should tell myself what I have told others before: have patience, but know what you're doing, just do it/them please. You got this. Somehow. Have Faith. The future is murky but have potentials, luck will come its way to meet hark work.
